#summary Version 2.0.0b12
=Version 2.0.0b12=
==Not Yet Released==

  * Fixed a bug in /reload where errors in a reloaded script weren't handled gracefully.
  * /reload is more verbose about which files it has reloaded.
  * Potato will no longer attempt Telnet negotiation if it doesn't happen in the first 90 seconds of the connection, to help prevent errors when non-Telnet aware connections send the Telnet escape character (typically a y-umlaut) as part of the text later.
  * An insanely stupid bug in the Spell Checking code could destroy the main Potato menu. Reported by elm@M*U*S*H.
  * A bug in the argument matching code for Events could stop a connection from working. Reported by James@M*U*S*H.
