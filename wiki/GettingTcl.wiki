= Downloading Tcl =

_Potato_ is written in [http://www.tcl.tk Tcl/Tk], an interpreted language available for many platforms. The [Downloads binary downloads] of _Potato_ include a Tcl interpreter, so you don't need to install one. However, if you're [RunFromSource running _Potato_ from SVN or the source], you'll need a copy of Tcl, too. Potato uses Tcl/Tk 8.5.

If you don't already have Tcl 8.5 installed on your system, we recommend you download a Tclkit. TclKits are single-file Tcl interpreters. They can be downloaded from the [http://code.google.com/p/tclkit/ TclKit Google Code page], and from [http://www.equi4.com/tclkit/download.html Equi4.com] (TclKits for different platforms are available from each site). Make sure you download version 8.5.X, and that you get Tclkit (which includes Tk, the GUI library for Tcl), not TclkitSH (which is command-line only).
