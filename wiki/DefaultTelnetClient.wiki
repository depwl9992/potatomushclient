#summary Make Potato the default Telnet Client

=Make Potato the default Telnet Client=

If you wish to make Potato the default telnet client (so that telnet://... links will open in Potato), you can do so in the following way:

==Microsoft XP==
Open My Computer, and select *Tools* â†’ *Folder Options*. Go to the *File Types* tab, and scroll down to *URL:Telnet Protocol* (the extension is (NONE)). Click the Advanced button.

In the window that opens, click the *Open* action, and click the Edit button.

A new window will open. For the "Application to perform this action", enter:

  `"C:\Path to\Your\Potato\potato.exe" %1`
  
Tick the "Use DDE" box, and then set:

  * DDE Message: `%1`
  * Application: `TclEval`
  * DDE Application Not Running: `-`
  * Topic: `potatoMUClient`
  
Click OK, OK and then Close to close all the windows. Potato should now launch whenever a telnet:// link is open and, if the program is already open, the address will open in the running copy.

==Other Operating Systems==
I don't know the procedure for doing this on other operating systems; if you know how to do it on other versions of Windows, or on any varieties of Linux, please [ContactMe let me know] how (preferably with any relevant screenshots). Thanks!
