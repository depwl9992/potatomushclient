#summary Version 2.0.0b8
=Version 2.0.0b8=
==Unreleased==

  * A new Help window, with lots of new and updated helpfiles.
  * MUSH passwords are now obfusticated on save.
  * Added Prefixes/Auto-Says, which can be accessed via the Edit menu, or the /setprefix command. Use `/send <text>` to send text without the prefix. Requested by Nathan Corbier.
  * Added a window (accessed via the File menu) for viewing MSSP info from the MUSH.
  * The Debug Packets window now uses the normal world colours.
  * You can now use 'Disconnect' to cancel auto-reconnect again.
  * You can now configure which Telnet options are negotiated. (Note that these options only take after the next reconnect.)
  * It's now possible to have multiple logfiles open per-connection at the same time.
  * Added the /at command, to send input at some point in the future. Syntax: `/at <time>=<input>`. `<input>` can be a /command.
  * Added /cancelat to cancel a previously entered /at.
  * Added support for Macros. Define macros via the Options menu, and run with `/run <macro>`.
  * Disabling/re-enabling Timers didn't work correctly. Reported by Paige.
  * You can now define multiple characters for each world, choose which to connect to, and set a default to connect to.
  * When Echo Input was enabled, connection strings were echoed with passwords visible. Now they're elided.
  * The ANSI parsing routine has been rewritten, for better parsing of XTerm/FANSI color codes. Reported by Paige.
  * Added the `/silent` command, which runs another /command but suppresses its success/error messages. Example: `/silent /at 1s=/print foo`.
  * The customizable 'F2' command didn't work due to a typo. Reported by Brev@ElendorMUSH.
  * Due to an encoding issue, Potato would mistake all y-umlaut characters for telnet IACs, even if they weren't. Much thanks to Brazil for finding this.
