==Unreleased==

  * Help fixes.
  * MUSH passwords are now obfusticated on save.
  * Added Prefixes/Auto-Says, which can be accessed via the Edit menu, or the /setprefix command. Use `/send <text>` to send text without the prefix. Requested by Nathan Corbier.
  * Added a window (accessed via the File menu) for viewing MSSP info from the MUSH.
  * The Debug Packets window now uses the normal world colours.
  * You can now use 'Disconnect' to cancel auto-reconnect again.
  * You can now configure which Telnet options are negotiated. (Note that these options only take after the next reconnect.)
  * It's now possible to have multiple logfiles open per-connection at the same time.
  * Added the /at command, to send input at some point in the future. Syntax: `/at <time>=<input>`. `<input>` can be a /command.
  * Added /cancelat to cancel a previously entered /at.
  * Added support for Macros. Define macros via the Options menu, and run with `/run <macro>`.
  * Disabling/re-enabling Timers didn't work correctly. Reported by Paige.
