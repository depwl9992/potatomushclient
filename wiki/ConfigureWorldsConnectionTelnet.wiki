#summary Configure World → Connection → Telnet

=Configure World → Connection → Telnet=

The *Telnet* page of the Connection World Configuration can be used to alter the telnet negotiation performed when connected to a MU`*`, or to disable it entirely, if the MU`*` does not perform telnet negotiation.

  * *Attempt Telnet Negotiation?*: Controls whether telnet negotiation is attempted. Highly recommended for any games which support it.
  * *Starting Encoding*: The encoding to use for the connection. The default is iso8859-1 - this is probably correct for most games, though some may use ascii or unicode/utf-8, and games in other languages may use something else.
  * *Negotiate Encoding?*: If the MU`*` supports negotiating encoding via telnet, should we do so? Generally a good idea to leave this enabled, although not many MU`*` servers support this (MUX being a notable exception). (Telnet protocol 42)
  * *Negotiate SSL?*: Not currently supported.
  * *Negotiate NAWS?*: Should Potato tell the MU`*` the window size? Some games alter their output to make best use of the available screenwidth. (Telnet protocol 31)
  * *Use NOP Keepalive?*: Should Potato regularly send a Telnet NOP to the MU`*` to act as a Keepalive? Useful for routers that kill connections with no regular activity.
  * *Handle GA/EOR Prompts?*: Should Potato use the telnet GOAHEAD/EOR characters for displaying MUD-style Prompts?
  * *Persist Prompts?*: When enabled, prompts will remain until cleared, either by the MU`*` or by the user. When disabled, the prompt is removed/reset as soon as a new line of text is received.
  * *Ignore NL after Prompts?*: If displaying prompts, should a newline immediately after the prompt GOAHEAD be ignored? Use this if you get a blank line in the output window every time your prompt is changed.
  * *Send Client Info?* Should Potato identify itself? (Telnet protocol 24)
  * *Send Client Name As:* If Potato has been told to identify itself as, how should it do so? Defaults to "Potato".
