#summary Version 2.0.0b13

=Version 2.0.0b13=
==Not Yet Released==

  * The input window sizes haven't been saved for some time, but now will be again. Reported by qa'toq, among others.
  * Fixed a potential bug in the SOCKS4 proxy code. Reported by Paige.
  * An unanchored regexp in a utility function was causing a fun, hard-to-find bug in the Slash Command config window. Reported by KimikoMuffin.
  * When you add a new /command, it will be enabled by default. Suggested by KimikoMuffin.
  * Added support for Overtype mode in text frames, toggled on and off with the Insert key. When on, anything you type will replace the character after the cursor, instead of appearing before it. Requested by Emi.
  * Pressing Return without typing anything will now send a blank line, instead of doing nothing. Useful for MUDs/MOOs/etc which ask you to press Return as a confirmation. Requested by Emi.
  * On MacOS X, you can enable systray flashing to animate the dock icon on activity.
  * The Help â†’ About window now shows the version of Potato being used, as well as some information about the machine it's running on and the versions of Tcl and various loaded packages, for easier debugging. Suggested by Paige.
  * Added a 'Connect to World' button in the Address Book.
  * Select to Copy is now a global option, not per-world, as it should have been all along. Suggested by spork.
  * When worlds are saved, the files now have more user-friendly names, based on the name of the world (MyMUSH-123.wld instead of just world123.wld).
  * The Upload File window could give an error when uploading extremely small files.
  * The potato.startup file was no longer working. Reported by Paige.
  * A potentially nasty bug when cancelling an attempted connection through a proxy has been fixed. Reported by Paige.
  * Potato is now extra-super-duper careful about not leaving dead connections (particularly to proxies) open.
  * When you cancel a connection attempt before the connection is established, Potato now tells you, instead of leaving it looking like it's trying to connect forever.
  * When picking an ambiguous world name, /connect always picks the one that comes first alphabetically.
  * Added the TLS package for Mac OS X to the source, to ensure SSL connections are always available.
  
  * Potato binaries are now built using Tcl/Tk 8.6.0, and some tweaks have been made to take advantage of new features in 8.6. If you're running Potato from source, it's recommended you [www.activestate.com/activetcl update your Tcl install] - the features listed below rely on it.
  * Support for connecting to IPv6 addresses.
  * On MacOS X, Potato will now bounce the application dock icon when there's new activity.
  * Possibly-better-looking tooltips on X11.
  * New font selection dialogs, using the native dialogs on Windows and MacOS X.
  
Many thanks to Yuriko and Minion for help testing the MacOS changes, and to Yuriko for building the Mac-specific extensions and Potato binary.
