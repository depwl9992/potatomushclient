#summary Quick Connect

=Quick Connect=

*Quick Connect* allows you to connect to a new world immediately, by just entering the host address and the port, and optionally a name for the world. It can be accessed in two ways:

  * Select *Quick Connect* from the *Connect To...* menu to display the Quick Connect window, or
  * Use the `/quick` [SlashCommands /command]. With no arguments, the Quick Connect Window is opened. If given a host and port (`/quick mush.pennmush.org:4201` or `/quick mush.pennmush.org 4201`) it will connect without opening the window.
