==Linux==

The easiest way to run Potato on Linux is currently [RunFromSource running from source]. There is no compiling required.

Linux binaries are no longer provided, as they actually proved more troublesome for people to use than the source. However, if you'd like a Linux binary, I can provide them on request.

==MacOS X==

As of version 2.0.0b12, a *[http://code.google.com/p/potatomushclient/downloads/list?can=2&q=OpSys%3AOSX+Featured MacOS X .dmg binary]* is available. These binaries are provided by Yuriko.

You can also run Potato on MacOS X, [RunFromSource from SVN, a Starkit or the source].

As I don't have access to a Mac myself, Potato is less-tested on MacOS.
