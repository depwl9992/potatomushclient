=Adding a New World=

There are two different methods for adding a new world in Potato:

  * Click the "New World" button in the [AddressBook Address Book]
  * Perform a [QuickConnect Quick Connect]
    * Select [FileMenu File] → *Connect To...* → *Quick Connect* menu, or
    * Use the `/quick` [SlashCommands /command].

Both methods ask you to enter a name, host (ip/address), and port number for the new world. A Quick Connect adds the world using the default world settings and then connects immediately, while adding a world through the Address Book brings up the [ConfigureWorlds World Configuration window] for you to change the new world's settings.
