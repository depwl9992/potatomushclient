  * Click the "New World" button in the [AddressBook Address Book]
  * Perform a Quick Connect
    * Select _Quick Connect_ from the _Connect To..._ menu, or
    * Use the `/quick` [SlashCommands /command].

Both methods ask you to enter a name, host (ip/address), and port number for the new world. A Quick Connect will then connect immediately, while adding a world through the Address Book brings up the [ConfigureWorlds World Configuration window] for you to change the new world's settings.
