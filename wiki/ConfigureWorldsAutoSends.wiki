#summary Configure World -> Auto-Sends

=Configure World -> Auto-Sends=

The Auto-Sends page allows you to enter commands to be sent to the MU`*` automatically upon connection. There are three; one is sent when you first connect, and is useful for running commands/macros which do not need to be repeated each time you disconnect/reconnect. The second is commands to send after connecting and before logging in, and the third is sent after logging in.

Each auto-send can send mulitple commands; enter each command on separate lines.
