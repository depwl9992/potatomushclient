Potato MU`*` Client 2.0.0b7 was written by Mike Griffiths (talvo@talvo.com). Based loosely on earlier code which was originally written by Keith Vetter (Brinli@ElendorMUSH).

  * Some ideas for the telnet processing code were taken from code written by Todd Martin, available from [http://wiki.tcl.tk/5644]
  * The Winflash library used on MS Windows was written by Youness El Alaoui (KaKaRoTo).
  * Potato uses the Winico extension on MS Windows to display an icon in the system tray.
  * The Font Selection and Help dialogs are based heavily on code written by (a different) Keith Vetter, and are available from [http://wiki.tcl.tk/16074] and [http://wiki.tcl.tk/19649] respectively.

Special thanks to Evelyn K. Vides for help and support, bug finding, and much much more. Eve also designed the Potato logo.

Potato is powered by the Tcl/Tk programming language and several extensions to it, and would not be possible without them.
