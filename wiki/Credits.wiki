Potato MU`*` Client was written by Mike Griffiths (talvo@talvo.com). Based loosely on earlier code which was originally written by Keith Vetter (Brinli@ElendorMUSH).

  * Some ideas for the telnet processing code were taken from code written by Todd Martin, available from [http://wiki.tcl.tk/5644]
  * The Winflash library used on MS Windows was written by Youness El Alaoui (!KaKaRoTo).
  * Potato uses the Winico extension on MS Windows to display an icon in the system tray.
  * The Font Selection dialog is based heavily on code written by (a different) Keith Vetter, and is available from [http://wiki.tcl.tk/16074].

Special thanks to Evelyn K. Vides for help and support, bug finding, and much much more. Eve also designed the Potato logo.

Potato is powered by the Tcl/Tk programming language and several extensions to it, and would not be possible without them.

On MS Windows, Potato includes the Winico extension for Tk, which is available from [http://tktable.sourceforge.net SourceForge]. Winico is used to place an icon in the system tray, and is Copyright Â© 1997-1998, Brueckner&Jarosch.

The Winflash extension is also used, for flashing windows on the taskbar to show activity. Winflash was written by Youness El Alaoui (!KaKaRoTo - kakaroto@users.sourceforge.net), and the version used in Potato was compiled by Evelyn K. Vides.

Translations provided by Stoko (Croatian), Nymeria (Swedish) and Bratto (Spanish).
