#summary Configure World → Characters

=Configure World → Characters=

The *Characters* page of the World Configuration has a list of existing characters at the top. You can select a character there and either *Edit Character* or *Delete Character* using the buttons at the bottom. When you edit a character (or *Add Character*), you can enter the character name and password in the *Character* and *Password* entry fields, then click *Save* to save the changes, or *Cancel* to discard them.

You can set one of the characters here as the *Default Character* on the [ConfigureWorldsBasics Basic Settings] page, and can also connect to any of them via the *Connect To...* menu.
