#summary Version 2.0.0b14

=Version 2.0.0b14=
==Not Yet Released==

  * Some slight modifications to the winflash code, for flashing the taskbar on Windows.
  * 64-bit versions of winflash, winico and tls provided by Givur, so that I can do native 64-bit Windows releases. Thank you, Givur!
  * Moved the MANIFEST file to a more sensible location, at the bottom of the directory tree.
  * Updated INSTALL file to recommend Tcl 8.6 and link to newer Tclkits for Windows.
  * Added a 'Donate' link in the Help menu. Suggested by qa'toq.
  * Overtype mode no longer lets you type over a carriage return/newline.
  * Control+A didn't always do "Select All" on Linux. Reported by Muse.
  * Inserts into spawn windows could happen in the wrong order, causing timestamps to be missed and errors to be thrown when Potato tried to display them. Reported by Merin.
  * When multiple events are matched, the text will be Omitted from Display if this option is enabled for any event, instead of only checking the first; this is more useful. Suggested by Merin.
