==Not Yet Released==

  * Potato now handles it better when you attempt an SSL connection to a game/port which doesn't support SSL. Reported by Paige and Huz.
  * The new Packet Debugger's two text windows scrolled correctly when you used the scrollbar, but not when you used the mousewheel or cursor keys. This has now been fixed.
  * MacOS lineendings (LF) are now handled correctly when sending text to a MU on MacOS X. Reported by Minion.
  * A long-standing bug involving scrolling with exceptionally long lines in the backscroll has finally been tracked down and fixed. Huzzah! Reported by Paige.
  * Logs can now optionally include timestamps. Suggested by anony858.
  * It's now possible to suppress some Activity notifications for specific [Events]. Suggestion and patch by Huz.
  * The mousewheel could occasionally scroll two text widgets at once. Reported by Paige.
  * A new [ConfigureWorldsConnectionTelnet per-world option] tells Potato to send a Telnet NOP (which does nothing) at regular intervals, to act as a keepalive. Suggested by Reaver.
  * Added a small margin to the left of the output text, to make selecting easier on some platforms. Requested by Minion.
  * New menu entries in the Text Editor and Mail Window for Cut/Copy/Paste. Suggested by Fally.
