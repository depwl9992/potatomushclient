1) Downloading Potato
---------------------
The latest release of Potato's source can be downloaded from 
http://code.google.com/p/potatomushclient/
You can also check out the source via SVN for the latest changes.

2) Installing Tcl/Tk
--------------------
  a) Windows
  ----------
  On Windows, you can download TclKit, a single-file Tcl/Tk executable, from
  http://tclkit.googlecode.com/files/tclkit-8.5.9-win32.upx.exe
  Place this .exe in the "potato.vfs" directory where this INSTALL file is
  located.

  b) Linux
  --------
   On Linux, the easiest way to install Tcl/Tk is through your OS's package
   management software. On debian based systems they are probably simply 
   called tcl and tk. If you want ssl support, also install tcl-tls. To 
   support window flashing, you'll also want tcl-dev and tk-dev:

     apt-get install tcl tk
     apt-get install tcl-tls
     apt-get install tcl-dev tk-dev

  On Gentoo they are called tcl and tk. For ssl support the package is 
  dev-tcltk/tls:

     emerge tcl tk
     emerge dev-tcltk/tls
  
  c) c) All platforms (Windows, Linux or MacOS X)
  -----------------------------------------------
  You can also obtain ActiveTcl 8.5 for Windows, Linux or MacOS X from
  ActiveState at http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads
  
  ActiveTcl is a full Tcl and Tk installation.
  
  For SSL support, you will need to cd to the tcl/bin directory and run
    teacup install tls
  
  On Windows, Start->Run, "cmd.exe", then
    cd c:\tcl\bin
    teacup install tls

3) Running Potato
-----------------
  a) Windows
  ---------
  If you downloaded the TclKit, simply drag-and-drop "main.tcl" onto the
  TclKit.exe to run.
  If using ActiveTcl, you can just double-click "main.tcl".
  
  b) Linux/MacOS X
  ----------------
    cd potato.vfs
    ./main.tcl
